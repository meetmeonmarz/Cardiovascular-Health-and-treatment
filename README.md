This project addresses the critical state of cardiovascular health in the United States, where heart disease is the leading cause of death and has significant economic impact.
To aid in research and improve early diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, we developed a database that tracks patients' basic information, cardiovascular history, and treatments. 
This database, compiled from public datasets or through partnerships with medical providers, aims to provide a valuable tool for researchers to analyze macro trends in treatments and their effectiveness. 
The report outlines the database's structure, emphasizing the organization and accessibility of the data.
